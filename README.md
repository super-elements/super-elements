# super-elements
Super Elements is a set of High Quality Web Components made with Polymer. They are designed to be perfectly compatible with other Custom Elements.

Wherever there is a popular requirement and a high quality component does not exist in the market, it is created as a `super-element`.

Our belief is that work should not be replicated. We contribute code to other elements so as to not replicate efforts. Other frameworks, utlities are also "componentized" into Polymer Elements here.
